# ESPPWMFanControl
This project reads the temperature from an 10 kOhm NTC (wired to 3.3V via 150 kOhm pull-up resistor) connected to A0 and enables you to automatically control three PWM channels separately.
Since the PWM frequency is limited on the ESP, the range of possible values has been reduced from 1024 to five states: 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %. This works well with our Arctic P12 PWM fans, even though we cannot measure the effective PWM frequency generated by the ESP8266.
A greater range may be possible, too, but has not been tested yet. This may also depend on the fans used and their tolerance in regards of the PWM frequency which may be lower than the by specification required 21~28 kHz though still work.
The settings are stored as JSON in SPIFFS.
The web interface provides you full control over the fan settings and also an auto refresh function as well as raw JSON output for further use (and some other stuff).
The project is pre-prepared to display the fan levels, temperature and the auto fan control state on an 128x64px OLED connected via I2C.

This project is in beta state. Testing is still needed and proper functionality not yet ensured.
